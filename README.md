This is the repository for my A Level python project - Mastermind
The repository contains all my code for various applications, as well as testing of various python libraries for the project. This includes pygame and its built in GUI library. Although it is a basic GUI it was suitable for the game as I was able to complete the desired function usin it. The code under "text_based" is a program written with only the random library and was created in order to understand the logic that was required for the project. It is entirely console based and can be run in web based compliers such as Python Tutor.
